### **Tanzania Fish Catch Prediction**



##### This is a Machine Learning web application that predicts the quantity of fish caught (in kg).

##### 

**Project Overview.**



The model uses historical data to estimate fish yields for common Tanzanian fish types. 

&nbsp;       It considers:

* &nbsp;  Fish Type: (Tilapia, Dagaa, Sangara, etc.)
* &nbsp;  Weather Conditions:(Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Dry)
* &nbsp;  Season:(Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)
* &nbsp;  Fishermen: Number of people involved in the catch.



**Tech Stack.**

* &nbsp;  Language: Python
* &nbsp;  Framework: \[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)
* &nbsp; ML Library: \[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
* &nbsp; Data Handling:Pandas \& NumPy
* &nbsp; Model Storage:Joblib



&nbsp;**File Structure**

* &nbsp;  app.py: The main script for the Streamlit web interface.
* &nbsp;  ml\_project.ipynb: The trained machine learning model.
* &nbsp;  requirements.txt: List of Python libraries required for deployment.
